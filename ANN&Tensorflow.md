Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been demonstrated to be effective in many cases of supervised learning, but programming an ANN manually can be a challenging task. As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation and use of ANNs. TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips.



TensorFlow provides algorithms and structure to implement Machine Learning using ANN and decision trees to compute large numerical datasets while maintaining accuracy. Tensorflow allows developers to create a graph of computations to perform. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation, and each connection represents data.
